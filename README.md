# SEC

Running data retrievers:

First; create a `.env` file that contains a variable named `email` and an email address to include along with requests to the SEC. On a Linux/Unix system, you can create a properly formatted `.env` file via the command below (with the example email replaced with a real one).

```bash
user@host:~/.../sec$ echo "email=example.email@email.com" > .env
```
